🍎🍐 Fruit Classification with CNN (Apples vs Pears)
📘 Project Overview
This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify fruit images as either apples or pears. It includes:

A data loading pipeline with automatic local file checks

Data extraction and preprocessing

CNN model definition and training

Accuracy evaluation and visualization of results

 What’s Inside
 Image classification using a simple CNN

 Automatic handling of data loading and extraction

 Training and testing on local fruit image datasets

 Visualization of training performance

Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch

Matplotlib

Ensure the image dataset is in place (or let the notebook extract it).

Run all cells to train the model and view results.

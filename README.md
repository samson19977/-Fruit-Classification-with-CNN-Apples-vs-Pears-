üçéüçê Fruit Classification with CNN (Apples vs Pears)
üìò Project Overview
This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify fruit images as either apples or pears. It includes:

A data loading pipeline with automatic local file checks

Data extraction and preprocessing

CNN model definition and training

Accuracy evaluation and visualization of results

 What‚Äôs Inside
 Image classification using a simple CNN

 Automatic handling of data loading and extraction

 Training and testing on local fruit image datasets

 Visualization of training performance

Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch

Matplotlib

OS & Zipfile modules for local data management

 Run the Notebook
Clone the repo or upload the notebook to a Colab environment.

Ensure the image dataset is in place (or let the notebook extract it).

Run all cells to train the model and view results.
